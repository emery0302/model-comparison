# model-comparison

Simulated data are used to compare different model performance. The linear mixed models have the same random effects but different fixed effects. I used AIC as the index to compare the model fit.


The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was introduced by Hirotugu Akaike in 1974 as a means of measuring the relative quality of a statistical model for a given dataset (Akaike, 1974). AIC is widely used for model comparison in several fields, including ecology and biology (Bolker et al., 2009; Burnham & Anderson, 2002). In the present research, AIC will be used for model comparison to determine whether including the environment as a cluster in models performs better than excluding it.
